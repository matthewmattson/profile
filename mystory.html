        <p>My love for design started when I was a child. One of my favorite memories was building an ERECTOR set motorized car (you’ll notice the punched metal and bolt theme in my logo). I distinctly remember not liking the way it looked. So I sketched up a new one on some paper and rebuilt it. As I got older I gravitated away from building kits entirely and began sketching up ideas on paper. When I finished a design I would attempt to build prototypes with whatever materials we had laying around the house. My dad was a contractor of sorts, so we had all types of lumber, PVC, wire, etc. around the house.</p>

        <p>In high school, I always got the most excited for my art and wood working classes, but wasn’t sure how that translated into a career once college hit. From a grade perspective, I did extremely well in science courses so I figured I’d start there. 3 years later, I was working a research job with the USDA, studying an invasive wood wasp species. At the end of that summer I decided a career in the biological sciences wasn’t for me. I loved the research part of the job, just not studying insects. That’s when I decided to make the move to business. Full disclaimer, I had no idea HCI (Human Computer Interaction) was a thing at this time in my life. Had I known, I would’ve picked this path in college. Instead I ended up getting my B.S. in Business Administration, with a focus in marketing & information systems. </p>

        <p>After graduation, I was dead set on analyzing human behavior to design better digitial experiences. And that’s exactly what I’ve been doing for the past 7 years. Specifically in a marketing setting, on front-end systems. Now, I'm making the transition into designing user experiences on the product side.</p>
